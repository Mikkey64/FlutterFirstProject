# flutter_application_1

My first project in Flutter. I used a lot of tutorial videos and courses but I 
gave up on making a server for something like this, not currently my level. 
It is also my first interaction with Github so sorry if I dont understand something or
I didnt add anything important here! 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
